- 👋 Hi, I’m @oranrick  
- 📝 I’m a journalism student with a deep passion for storytelling, pragmatics, and the intricate ways language shapes society. I’m fascinated by how narratives influence culture, politics, and human connections.  
- 👀 I’m interested in media analysis, AI-driven misinformation, and the power of discourse to create empathy in an increasingly polarized world. My work explores the intersection of technology, ethics, and communication.  
- 🌱 I’m currently researching **deepfakes in political conflicts** for a special journalistic project and developing my thesis on how language can serve as a tool for social cohesion rather than division.   
- 💡 My academic journey blends **anthropology, semiotics, and journalism**, always questioning the narratives we take for granted.   
- 🎥 I love analyzing media, from **YouTube channels on AI** to the **structure of digital storytelling in short-form content**.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to **media literacy, investigative journalism, or narrative-driven research on misinformation and AI**. If your work involves **dissecting the ethics of modern journalism or experimenting with innovative media formats**, let’s talk!  
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me here or drop me a message on [your preferred contact method].   
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can switch from discussing **Hannah Arendt and semiotic theory** to **Kali Uchis’ discography** in seconds. Also, I’m the kind of person who watches Kurzgesagt videos to remind myself that existential dread can be aesthetically pleasing.
